        <td>Caldera</td>
        <td>A caldera is a large cauldron-like hollow that forms shortly after the emptying of a magma chamber/reservoir
          in a volcanic eruption. When large volumes of magma are erupted over a short time, structural support for the
          rock above the magma chamber is lost. The ground surface then collapses downward into the emptied or partially
          emptied magma chamber, leaving a massive depression at the surface (from one to dozens of kilometers in
          diameter). Although sometimes described as a crater, the feature is actually a type of sinkhole, as it is
          formed through subsidence and collapse rather than an explosion or impact. Only seven caldera-forming
          collapses are known to have occurred since 1900, most recently at Bárðarbunga volcano, Iceland in 2014.</td>

        <td>Complex volcano</td>
        <td>A complex volcano, also called a compound volcano, is mixed landform consisting of related volcanic centers
          and their associated lava flows and pyroclastic rock. They may form due to changes in eruptive habit or in the
          location of the principal vent area on a particular volcano. Stratovolcanoes can also form a large caldera
          that gets filled in by a lava dome, or else multiple small cinder cones, lava domes and craters may develop on
          the caldera&#39;s rim.Although a comparatively unusual type of volcano, they are widespread in the world and
          in geologic history. Metamorphosed ash flow tuffs are widespread in the Precambrian rocks of northern New
          Mexico, which indicates that caldera complexes have been important for much of Earth&#39;s history.
          Yellowstone National Park is on three partly covered caldera complexes. The Long Valley Caldera in eastern
          California is also a complex volcano; the San Juan Mountains in southwestern Colorado are formed on a group of
          Neogene-age caldera complexes, and most of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic rocks of Nevada, Idaho, and eastern
          California are also caldera complexes and their erupted ash flow tuffs. The Bennett Lake Caldera in British
          Columbia and the Yukon Territory is another example of a Cenozoic (Eocene) caldera complex.</td>

        <td>Volcanic cones are among the simplest volcanic landforms. They are built by ejecta from a volcanic vent,
          piling up around the vent in the shape of a cone with a central crater. Volcanic cones are of different types,
          depending upon the nature and size of the fragments ejected during the eruption. Types of volcanic cones
          include stratocones, spatter cones, tuff cones, and cinder cones.<br /><br /></td>

        <td>An explosion crater is a type of crater formed when material is ejected from the surface of the ground by an
          explosive event at or immediately above or below the surface.<br /><br />A crater is formed by an explosive
          event through the displacement and ejection of material from the ground. It is typically bowl-shaped.
          High-pressure gas and shock waves cause three processes responsible for the creation of the
          crater:<br /><br />Plastic deformation of the ground.<br />Projection of material (ejecta) from the ground by
          the explosion.<br />Spallation of the ground surface.Two processes partially fill the crater back
          in:<br /><br />Fall-back of ejecta.<br />Erosion and landslides of the crater lip and wall.The relative
          importance of the five processes varies, depending on the height above or depth below the ground surface at
          which the explosion occurs and on the composition of the ground.</td>

        <td>Fissure vent</td>
        <td>A fissure vent, also known as a volcanic fissure, eruption fissure or simply a fissure, is a linear volcanic
          vent through which lava erupts, usually without any explosive activity. The vent is often a few meters wide
          and may be many kilometers long. Fissure vents can cause large flood basalts which run first in lava channels
          and later in lava tubes. After some time the eruption builds up spatter cones and may concentrate on one or
          some of them. Small fissure vents may not be easily discernible from the air, but the crater rows (see Laki)
          or the canyons (see Eldgjá) built up by some of them are.<br />The dikes that feed fissures reach the surface
          from depths of a few kilometers and connect them to deeper magma reservoirs, often under volcanic centers.
          Fissures are usually found in or along rifts and rift zones, such as Iceland and the East African Rift.
          Fissure vents are often part of the structure of shield volcanoes.<br /><br /></td>

        <td>Lava cone</td>
        <td>A lava cone is a type of volcano composed primarily of viscous lava flows. The volcanic cone can contain a
          convex profile due to the flank flows of viscous lava.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Lava dome</td>
        <td>In volcanology, a lava dome or volcanic dome is a roughly circular mound-shaped protrusion resulting from
          the slow extrusion of viscous lava from a volcano. Dome-building eruptions are common, particularly in
          convergent plate boundary settings. Around 6% of eruptions on earth are lava dome forming. The geochemistry of
          lava domes can vary from basalt (e.g. Semeru, 1946) to rhyolite (e.g. Chaiten, 2010) although the majority are
          of intermediate composition (such as Santiaguito, dacite-andesite, present day) The characteristic dome shape
          is attributed to high viscosity that prevents the lava from flowing very far. This high viscosity can be
          obtained in two ways: by high levels of silica in the magma, or by degassing of fluid magma. Since viscous
          basaltic and andesitic domes weather fast and easily break apart by further input of fluid lava, most of the
          preserved domes have high silica content and consist of rhyolite or dacite.<br />Existence of lava domes has
          been suggested for some domed structures on the Moon, Venus, and Mars, e.g. the Martian surface in the western
          part of Arcadia Planitia and within Terra Sirenum.</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Maar</td>
        <td>A maar is a broad, low-relief volcanic crater caused by a phreatomagmatic eruption (an explosion which
          occurs when groundwater comes into contact with hot lava or magma). A maar characteristically fills with water
          to form a relatively shallow crater lake which may also be called a maar. The name comes from a Moselle
          Franconian dialect word used for the circular lakes of the Daun area of Germany.<br />Maars are shallow,
          flat-floored craters that scientists interpret as having formed above diatremes as a result of a violent
          expansion of magmatic gas or steam; deep erosion of a maar presumably would expose a diatreme. Maars range in
          size from 60 to 8,000 m (200 to 26,250 ft) across and from 10 to 200 m (33 to 656 ft) deep; most maars
          commonly fill with water to form natural lakes. Most maars have low rims composed of a mixture of loose
          fragments of volcanic rocks and rocks torn from the walls of the diatreme.</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Pyroclastic shield</td>
        <td>In volcanology, a pyroclastic shield or ignimbrite shield is an uncommon type of shield volcano. Unlike most
          shield volcanoes, pyroclastic shields are formed mostly of pyroclastic and highly explosive eruptions rather
          than relatively fluid basaltic lava issuing from vents or fissures on the surface of the volcano.<br />They
          typically display low-angle flank slopes and often have a central caldera caused by large eruptions. Lava is
          commonly extruded after explosive activity has ended. The paucity of associated Plinian fall deposits
          indicates that pyroclastic shields are characterized by low Plinian columns.<br />Pyroclastic shields are
          commonly known to form in the Central Andes of South America, as well as in Melanesia (the island of
          Bougainville alone has two). There are also pyroclastic shields in Africa, such as Emi Koussi in Chad.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Stratovolcano</td>
        <td>A stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, is a conical volcano built up by many layers (strata) of
          hardened lava, tephra, pumice and ash. Unlike shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep
          profile with a summit crater and periodic intervals of explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions, although
          some have collapsed summit craters called calderas. The lava flowing from stratovolcanoes typically cools and
          hardens before spreading far, due to high viscosity. The magma forming this lava is often felsic, having
          high-to-intermediate levels of silica (as in rhyolite, dacite, or andesite), with lesser amounts of
          less-viscous mafic magma. Extensive felsic lava flows are uncommon, but have travelled as far as 15 km (9.3
          mi).Stratovolcanoes are sometimes called &quot;composite volcanoes&quot; because of their composite stratified
          structure built up from sequential outpourings of erupted materials. They are among the most common types of
          volcanoes, in contrast to the less common shield volcanoes. Two famous examples of stratovolcanoes are
          Krakatoa in Indonesia, known for its catastrophic eruption in 1883 and Vesuvius in Italy, whose catastrophic
          eruption in AD 79 ruined the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum. Both eruptions claimed thousands of
          lives. In modern times, Mount Saint Helens and Mount Pinatubo have erupted catastrophically, with fewer
          deaths.<br />The possible existence of stratovolcanoes on other terrestrial bodies of the Solar System has not
          been conclusively demonstrated. The one feasible exception is the existence of some isolated massifs on Mars,
          for example the Zephyria Tholus.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Subglacial volcano</td>
        <td>A subglacial volcano, also known as a glaciovolcano, is a volcanic form produced by subglacial eruptions or
          eruptions beneath the surface of a glacier or ice sheet which is then melted into a lake by the rising lava.
          Today they are most common in Iceland and Antarctica; older formations of this type are found also in British
          Columbia and Yukon Territory, Canada.<br />During the eruption, the heat of the lava from the subglacial
          volcano melts the overlying ice. The water quickly cools the lava, resulting in pillow lava shapes similar to
          those of underwater volcanoes. When the pillow lavas break off and roll down the volcano slopes, pillow
          breccia, tuff breccia, and hyaloclastite form. The meltwater may be released from below the ice as happened in
          Iceland in 1996 when the Grímsvötn caldera erupted, melting 3 km3 of ice and giving rise to a large glacial
          lake outburst flood.<br />The shape of subglacial volcanoes tends to be quite characteristic and unusual, with
          a flattened top and steep sides supported against collapse by the pressure of the surrounding ice and
          meltwater. If the volcano eventually melts completely through the ice layer, then horizontal lava flows are
          deposited, and the top of the volcano assumes a nearly level form. However, if significant amounts of lava are
          later erupted subaerially, then the volcano may assume a more conventional shape. In Canada the volcanos have
          been known to form both conical and nearly level shapes. The more distinctly flat-topped, steep-sided
          subglacial volcanoes are called tuyas, named after Tuya Butte in northern British Columbia by Canadian
          geologist Bill Mathews in 1947. In Iceland, such volcanoes are also known as table mountains.</td>

        <td>Submarine volcano</td>
        <td>Submarine volcanoes are underwater vents or fissures in the Earth&#39;s surface from which magma can erupt.
          A large number of submarine volcanoes are located near areas of tectonic plate movement, known as mid-ocean
          ridges. The volcanoes at mid-ocean ridges alone are estimated to account for 75% of the magma output on Earth.
          Although most submarine volcanoes are located in the depths of seas and oceans, some also exist in shallow
          water, and these can discharge material into the atmosphere during an eruption. The total number of submarine
          volcanoes is estimated to be over 1 million, of which some 75,000 rise more than 1 km above the
          seabed.Hydrothermal vents, sites of abundant biological activity, are commonly found near submarine volcanoes.

        <td>Agglomerate</td>
        <td>Agglomerate (from the Latin agglomerare meaning &quot;to form into a ball&quot;) is a coarse accumulation of
          large blocks of volcanic material that contains at least 75% bombs. Volcanic bombs differ from volcanic blocks
          in that their shape records fluidal surfaces: they may, for example, have ropy, cauliform, scoriaceous, or
          folded, chilled margins and spindle, spatter, ribbon, ragged, or amoeboid shapes. Globular masses of lava may
          have been shot from the crater at a time when partly molten lava was exposed, and was frequently shattered by
          sudden outbursts of steam. These bombs were viscous at the moment of ejection and by rotation in the air
          acquired their shape. They are commonly 1 to 2 feet (30 to 60 cm) in diameter, but specimens as large as 12
          feet (3.7 m) have been observed. There is less variety in their composition at any one volcanic centre than in
          the case of the lithic blocks, and their composition indicates the type of magma being
          erupted.<br />Agglomerates are typically found near volcanic vents and within volcanic conduits, where they
          may be associated with pyroclastic or intrusive volcanic breccias. Older (pre-1970) publications, particularly
          in Scotland, referred to any coarse-grained volcaniclastic rock as &#39;agglomerate&#39;, which led to debris
          flow deposits, talus deposits and other types of breccia being mistaken for vents. Agglomerates are typically
          poorly sorted, may contain a fine ash or tuff matrix and vary from matrix to clast support. They may be
          monolithologic or heterolithic, and may contain some blocks of various igneous rocks. There are various
          differences between agglomerates and ordinary ash beds or tuffs. Agglomerates are coarser and less frequently
          well-bedded. Agglomerates can be non-welded or welded, such as coarse basaltic &#39;spatter&#39;. They
          typically form proximally during Strombolian eruptions, and are common at strongly peralkaline volcanoes. Some
          large agglomerate deposits are deposited from pyroclastic density currents during explosive caldera-forming
          eruptions, such as at Santorini, Taal, and Campi Flegrei. They may be massive to crudely bedded, and can
          attain great thicknesses.<br />Crystalline masses of a different kind occur in some numbers in certain
          agglomerates. They consist of volcanic minerals very much the same as those formed in the lava, but exhibiting
          certain peculiarities which indicate that they have formed slowly under pressure at considerable depths. They
          bear a resemblance to plutonic igneous rocks, but are more correctly to be regarded as agglomerations of
          crystals formed within the liquid lava as it slowly rose towards the surface, and at a subsequent period cast
          out by violent steam explosions. The sanidinites of the Eifel belong to this group. At Vesuvius, Ascension, St
          Vincent and many other volcanoes, they form a considerable part of the coarser ash-beds. Their commonest
          minerals are olivine, anorthite, hornblende, augite, biotite and leucite.</td>

        <td>Andesite</td>
        <td>Andesite ( or ) is an extrusive igneous,
          volcanic rock, of intermediate composition, with aphanitic to porphyritic texture. In a general sense, it is
          the intermediate type between basalt and rhyolite, and ranges from 57 to 63% silicon dioxide (SiO2) as
          illustrated in TAS diagrams. The mineral assemblage is typically dominated by plagioclase plus pyroxene or
          hornblende. Magnetite, zircon, apatite, ilmenite, biotite, and garnet are common accessory minerals. Alkali
          feldspar may be present in minor amounts. The quartz-feldspar abundances in andesite and other volcanic rocks
          are illustrated in QAPF diagrams.<br />Classification of andesites may be refined according to the most
          abundant phenocryst. Example: hornblende-phyric andesite, if hornblende is the principal accessory
          mineral.<br />Andesite can be considered as the extrusive equivalent of plutonic diorite. Characteristic of
          subduction zones, andesite represents the dominant rock type in island arcs. The average composition of the
          continental crust is andesitic. Along with basalts they are a major component of the Martian crust. The name

          volcanic rock on Earth is basalt. Basalt lava has a low viscosity, due to its low silica content, resulting in
          rapid lava flows that can spread over great areas before cooling and solidification. Flood basalt describes

          precise definition. Color is generally white through light gray, or red to tan and may include any color
          except dark gray, green or black (the colors of trap rock). The mass of the rock consists of a fine-grained
          matrix of felsic materials, particularly quartz, sodium and potassium feldspar, and may be termed a quartz
          felsite or quartz porphyry if the quartz phenocrysts are present. This rock is typically of extrusive origin,
          formed by compaction of fine volcanic ash, and may be found in association with obsidian and rhyolite. In some
          cases, it is sufficiently fine-grained for use in making stone tools. Its fine texture and felsic components
          allow for good knapped pieces, much like working chert, producing conchoidal fracture. <br />Dendritic
          manganese oxides such as pyrolusite and/or iron oxides such as limonite may precipitate along rock crevices,

          frequently displays spinifex texture composed of large dendritic plates of olivine and
          pyroxene.<br />Komatiites are rare and predominantly found in rocks of Archaean age, with few Proterozoic or
          Phanerozoic komatiites known. This restriction in age is thought to be due to cooling of the mantle, which may
          have been 100 – 250°C hotter during the Archaean (4.0 to 2.5 billion years ago). The early Earth had much
          higher heat production, due to the residual heat from planetary accretion, as well as the greater abundance of
          radioactive elements. Lower temperature mantle melts such as basalt and picrite have essentially replaced
          komatiites as an eruptive lava on the Earth&#39;s surface.<br />Geographically, komatiites are predominantly
          restricted in distribution to the Archaean shield areas, and occur with other ultramafic and high-magnesian
          mafic volcanic rocks in Archaean greenstone belts. The youngest komatiites are from the island of Gorgona on
          the Caribbean oceanic plateau off the Pacific coast of Colombia, and a rare example of Proterozoic komatiite

        <td>Leucitite</td>
        <td>Leucitite or leucite rock is an igneous rock containing leucite. It is scarce, many countries such as
          England being entirely without them. However, they are of wide distribution, occurring in every quarter of the
          globe. Taken collectively, they exhibit a considerable variety of types and are of great interest
          petrographically. For the presence of this mineral it is necessary that the silica percentage of the rock
          should be low, since leucite is incompatible with free quartz and reacts with it to form potassium feldspar.
          Because it weathers rapidly, leucite is most common in lavas of recent and Tertiary age, which have a fair
          amount of potassium, or at any rate have potassium equal to or greater than sodium; if sodium is abundant
          nepheline occurs rather than leucite.<br />In pre-Tertiary rocks leucite readily decomposes and changes to
          zeolites, analcite and other secondary minerals. Leucite also is rare in plutonic rocks and dike rocks, but
          leucite syenite and leucite tinguaite bear witness to the possibility that it may occur in this manner. The
          rounded shape of its crystals, their white or grey color, and absence of planar cleavage make the presence of
          leucite easily determinable in many of these rocks by inspection, especially when the crystals are
          large.<br /><br />&quot;Pseudoleucites&quot; are rounded areas consisting of feldspar, nepheline, analcite,
          &amp;c., which have the shape, composition and sometimes even the outward crystalline shape of leucite; they
          are probably pseudomorphs or paramorphs, which have developed from leucite because this mineral is not stable
          at ordinary temperatures and can be expected under favorable conditions to undergo spontaneous change into an
          aggregate of other minerals. Leucite is very often accompanied by nepheline, sodalite or nosean; other
          minerals which make their appearance with some frequency are melanite, garnet and melilite.<br />The plutonic
          leucite-bearing rocks are leucite syenite and missourite. Of these the former consists of orthoclase,
          nepheline, sodalite, diopside and aegirine, biotite and sphene. Two occurrences are known, one in Arkansas,
          the other in Sutherland, Scotland. The Scottish rock has been called borolanite. Both examples show large
          rounded spots in the hand specimens; they are pseudoleucites, and under the microscope prove to consist of
          orthoclase, nepheline, sodalite and decomposition products. These have a radiate arrangement externally, but
          are of irregular structure at their centres; in both rocks melanite is an important accessory. The missourites
          are more mafic and consist of leucite, olivine, augite and biotite; the leucite is partly fresh partly altered
          to analcite, and the rock has a spotted character recalling that of the leucite-syenites. It has been found
          only in the Highwood Mountains of Montana.<br />The leucite-hearing dike-rocks are members of the tinguaite
          and monchiquite groups. The leucite tinguaites are usually pale grey or greenish in color and consist
          principally of nepheline, alkali feldspar and aegirine. The latter forms bright green moss-like patches and
          growths of indefinite shape, or in other cases scattered acicular prisms, among the feldspars and nephelines
          of the ground mass. Where leucite occurs, it is always euhedral in small, equant, many-sided crystals in the
          ground mass, or in larger masses which have the same characters as the pseudoleucites. Biotite occurs in some
          of these rocks, and melanite also is present. Nepheline decreases in amount as leucite increases since the
          abundances of the two reflect the Na:K ratio of the rock. Rocks of this group are known from Rio de Janeiro,
          Arkansas, Kola Peninsula (in Russia), Montana and a few other places., In Greenland there are leucite
          tinguaites with much arfvedsonite, (hornblende) and eudialyte. Wherever they occur they accompany leucite- and
          nepheline syenites. Leucite monchiquites are fine-grained dark rocks consisting of olivine, titaniferous
          augite and iron oxides, with a glassy ground mass in which small rounded crystals of leucite are scattered.
          They have been described from Czechoslovakia.<br />By far the greater number of the rocks which contain
          leucite are lavas of Tertiary or recent geological age. Although these never contain quartz, but feldspar is
          usually present, though there are certain groups of leucite lavas which are non-feldspathic. Many of them also
          contain nepheline, sodalite, hauyne and nosean; the much rarer mineral melilite appears also in some examples.
          The commonest ferromagnesian mineral is augite (sometimes rich in sodium), with olivine in the more basic
          varieties. Hornblende and biotite occur also, but are less common. Melanite is found in some of the lavas, as
          in the leucite syenites.<br />The rocks in which orthoclase (or sanidine) is present in considerable amount
          are leucite-trachytes, leucite-phonolites and leucitophvres. Of these groups the two former, which are not
          sharply distinguished from one another by most authors, are common in the neighborhood of Rome. They are of
          trachytic appearance, containing phenocysts of sanidine, leucite, augite and biotite. Sodalite or hauyne may
          also be present, but nepheline is typically absent. Rocks of this class occur also in the tuffs of the
          Phlegraean Fields, near Naples. The leucitophyres are rare rocks which have been described from various parts
          of the volcanic district of the Rhine (Olbrck. Laacher See, etc.) and from Monte Vulture in Italy. They are
          rich in leucite, but contain also some sanidine and often much nepheline with hauyne or nosean. Their pyroxene
          is principally aegirine or aegirine-augite; some of them are rich in melanite. Microscopic sections of some of
          these rocks are of great interest on account of their beauty and the variety of feldspathoid minerals which
          they contain. In Brazil leucitophyres have been found which belong to the Carboniferous period.<br />Those
          leucite rocks which contain abundant essential plagioclase feldspar are known as leucite tephrites and leucite
          basanites. The former consist mainly of plagioclase, leucite and augite, while the latter contain olivine in
          addition. The leucite is often present in two sets of crystals, both porphyritic and as an ingredient of the
          ground mass. It is always idiomorphic with rounded outlines. The feldspar ranges from bytownite to oligoclase,
          being usually a variety of labradorite; orthoclase is scarce. The augite varies a good deal in chemnistry and
          optical character, being green, brown or violet (suggesting high Na and Ti content), but it is rarely high
          enough in Na and Fe to qualify as aegirine-augite or aegirine. Among the accessory minerals biotite, brown
          hornblende, hauyne, iron oxides and apatite are the commonest; melanite and nepheline may also occur. The
          ground mass of these rocks is only occasionally rich in glass. The leucite-tephrites and leucite-basanites of
          Vesuvius and Somma are familiar examples of this class of rocks. They are black or ashy-grey in color, often
          vesicular, and may contain many large grey phenocysts of leucite. Their black augite and yellow green olivine
          are also easily observed in hand specimens. From Volcan Ello, Sardinia and Roccamonfina similar rocks are
          obtained; they occur also in Bohemia, in Java, Celebes, Kilimanjaro (Africa) and near Trebizond in Asia
          Minor.<br />Leucite lavas from which feldspar is absent are divided into the leucitites and leucite basalts.
          The latter contain olivine, the former do not. Pyroxene is the usual ferromagnesian mineral, and resembles
          that of the tephrites and basanites. Sanidine, melanite, hauyne and perovskite are frequent accessory minerals
          in these rocks, and many of them contain melilite in some quantity, The well-known leucitite of the Capo di
          Bove, near, Rome, is rich in this mineral, which forms irregular plates, yellow in the hand specimen,
          enclosing many small rounded crystals of leucite. Bracciano and Roccamonfina are other Italian localities for
          leucitite, and in Java, Montana, Celebes and New South Wales similar rocks occur, The leucite basalts belong
          to more basic types and are rich in olivine and augite. They occur in great numbers in the Rhenish volcanic
          district (Eifel, Laacher See) and in Bohemia, and accompany tephrites or leucitites in Java, Montana, Celebes
          and Sardinia. The peperino of the neighborhood of Rome is a leucitite tuff.<br /><br /></td>

        <td>Nephelinite</td>
        <td>Nephelinite is a fine-grained or aphanitic igneous rock made up almost entirely of nepheline and
          clinopyroxene (variety augite). If olivine is present, the rock may be classified as an olivine nephelinite.
          Nephelinite is dark in color and may resemble basalt in hand specimen. However, basalt consists mostly of
          clinopyroxene (augite) and calcic plagioclase.<br />Basalt, alkali basalt, basanite, tephritic nephelinite,
          and nephelinite differ partly in the relative proportions of plagioclase and nepheline. Alkali basalt may
          contain minor nepheline and does contain nepheline in its CIPW normative mineralogy. A critical ratio in the
          classification of these rocks is the ratio nepheline/(nepheline plus plagioclase). Basanite has a value of
          this ratio between 0.1 and 0.6 and also contains more than 10% olivine. Tephritic nephelinite has a value
          between 0.6 and 0.9. Nephelinite has a value greater than 0.9. Le Maitre (2002) defines and discusses these
          and other criteria in the classification of igneous rocks.<br />Nephelinite is an example of a
          silica-undersaturated igneous rock. The degree of silica saturation can be evaluated with normative mineralogy
          calculated from chemical analyses, or with actual mineralogy for completely crystallized igneous rocks with
          equilibrated assemblages. Silica-oversaturated rocks contain quartz (or another silica polymorph).
          Silica-undersaturated mafic igneous rocks contain magnesian olivine but not magnesian orthopyroxene, and/or a
          feldspathoid. Silica-saturated igneous rocks fall in between these two classes.<br />Silica-undersaturated,
          mafic igneous rocks are much less abundant than silica-saturated and oversaturated basalts. Genesis of the
          less common mafic rocks such as nephelinite is usually ascribed to more than one of the following three
          causes:<br /><br />relatively high pressure of melting;<br />relatively low degree of fractional melting in a
          mantle source;<br />relatively high dissolved carbon dioxide in the melt.Nephelinites and similar rocks
          typically contain relatively high concentrations of elements such as the light rare earths, as consistent with
          a low degree of melting of mantle peridotite at depths sufficient to stabilize garnet. Nephelinites are also
          associated with carbonatite in some occurrences, consistent with source rocks relatively rich in carbon
          dioxide.<br />Nephelinite is found on ocean islands such as Oahu, although the rock type is very rare in the
          Hawaiian islands. It is found in a variety of continental settings. An example is the Hamada nephelinite lava
          flow in southwest Japan which occurred in the late Miocene age. Nephelinite is also associated with the highly
          alkalic volcanism of the Ol Doinyo Lengai volcanic field in Tanzania. Nyiragongo, another African volcano
          known for its semipermanent lava lake activity, erupts lava made of melilite nephelinite. The unusual chemical
          makeup of this igneous rock may be a factor in the unusual fluidity of its lavas.<br /><br />Olivine
          nephelinite flows also occur in the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field in east-central British Columbia and
          at Volcano Mountain in central Yukon Territory. Melilite olivine nephelinite intrusives of Cretaceous age are
          found in the area around Uvalde, Texas.</td>

          when felsic lava extruded from a volcano cools rapidly with minimal crystal growth. It is commonly found
          within the margins of rhyolitic lava flows known as obsidian flows, where the chemical composition (high
          silica content) causes a high viscosity which, upon rapid cooling, forms a natural glass from the lava. The
          inhibition of atomic diffusion through this highly viscous lava explains the lack of crystal growth. Obsidian
          is hard, brittle, and amorphous; it therefore fractures with very sharp edges. In the past it was used to
          manufacture cutting and piercing tools and it has been used experimentally as surgical scalpel blades.</td>
